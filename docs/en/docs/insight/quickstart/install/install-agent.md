# Install insight-agent

insight-agent is a plugin for collecting insight data, supporting unified observation of metrics, links, and log data. This article describes how to install insight-agent in an online environment for the accessed cluster.

## Prerequisites

Please confirm that your cluster has successfully connected to the `container management` platform. You can refer to [Integrate Clusters](../../../kpanda/user-guide/clusters/integrate-cluster.md) for details.

## Steps

    If you need to modify the data reporting address, please refer to [Get Data Reporting Address](./gethosturl.md).

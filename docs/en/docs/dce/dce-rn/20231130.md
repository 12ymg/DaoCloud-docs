## Cautions

- **Container Management**: When upgrading from v0.21.x to v0.22.0 and higher, if the Global Cluster uses Redis in sentinel mode, you need to change `--set global.db.redis.url`.
- **Global Management**: When upgrading from v0.15.x (or lower) to v0.21.0 (or higher), the database connection Helm parameter format needs to be modified. Please refer to [Offline Upgrade Global Management](../../ghippo/install/offline-install.md) for details.
- **Insight**: For Insight Agent versions 0.20.0 and below, there is the problem of collecting multiple copies of JVM metrics data with PodMonitor, requiring modification of the corresponding configuration. Please refer to [PodMonitor collects multiple copies of JVM metrics data](../../insight/quickstart/install/knownissues.md#podmonitor-jvm) for details.
- **Workbench**: When upgrading from versions before v0.21.0 to this version, gitops applications may disappear. It is recommended not to upgrade to this version directly, but to upgrade to v0.22.0 and above.

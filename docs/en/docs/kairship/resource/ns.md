# Multicloud Namespace

A multicloud namespace can manage workloads across clouds and across clusters. Currently, a wizard-based creation method is provided.

This article takes wizard creation as an example, and follows the steps below.

1. After entering a multicloud instance, in the left navigation bar, click __Resource Management__ -> __Multicloud Namespace__ , and click the __Create Namespace__ button in the upper right corner.

2. On the __Create Multicloud Namespace__ page, enter a name, add a tag, and click __OK__ .

    ![Fill](../images/ns02.png)

3. Return to the list of multicloud namespaces, and the newly created one will be the first one by default. Click __â‹®__ on the right side of the list to edit the YAML and delete the namespace.

    !!! note

        To delete a namespace, you need to remove all workloads under the namespace first. After the deletion, the workloads and services in the namespace will be affected, so please proceed with caution.

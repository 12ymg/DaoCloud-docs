# Operations Management

IT operations management is an important part of the entire enterprise information construction. DCE 5.0 provides two operational management features, [ __Report Management__ ](./report.md) and [ __Billing and Metering__ ](./billing.md), aimed at helping enterprises better understand their IT infrastructure usage and the value of IT services provided.

## Report Management

Report management is one of the core tasks of IT operations management. It collects, integrates, analyzes and visualizes enterprise IT resources to provide decision support for enterprise management, thereby achieving effective control of enterprise IT assets.

First, by centrally displaying various types of reports, enterprises can more accurately understand the utilization and usage of IT resources. For example, in the cluster report, administrators can view information such as the number of nodes and resource utilization rates in different clusters; in the node report, administrators can view information such as IP addresses, types, belonging clusters, and resource utilization rates for each node. With these reports, administrators can better partition and schedule computing resources.

Secondly, through audit reports, enterprises can understand user operations and operations performed on resources, making it easy for enterprises to grasp resource utilization and track user operation traces. Through alert reports, enterprises can generate cluster inspection reports, quickly diagnose problems and handle them.

Finally, the report management module also supports customized time ranges and searches, helping administrators better understand the usage of enterprise IT resources. In addition, it provides the feature of exporting/downloading data, allowing administrators to conduct in-depth analysis of the data.

## Billing and Metering

On the other hand, billing and metering are also important components of IT operations management. Billing and metering mainly measure and bill the value of enterprise IT services through the collection and analysis of enterprise IT resources.

First, the billing and metering module can help enterprises understand the true value of IT services provided and determine reasonable charging standards. For example, in a cloud computing environment, enterprises can charge based on actual usage by calculating the amount of resources that users actually use.

Secondly, the billing and metering module can also help enterprises achieve refined billing and improve their profitability. For example, in a virtual machine scenario, administrators can calculate the usage fees for each user based on metrics such as CPU, memory, and storage, and charge differentially based on actual usage.

Finally, the billing and metering module also supports customized billing rules and cycles and can generate detailed bills, making it easy for enterprises to track and manage IT service costs.

In summary, IT operations management includes two aspects: report management and billing and metering. They can help enterprises better understand their IT infrastructure usage and the value of IT services provided. Through the implementation of report management and billing and metering modules, enterprises can operate IT environments more efficiently, while maintaining profitability and improving IT service quality and user satisfaction.

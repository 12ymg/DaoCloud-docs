## Troubleshooting Process

1. Q: Is the operation procedure correct?

    A: Apply the CRD(s) first, then perform the helm upgrade. The operation procedure is correct, ruling out operation issues.

1. Q: Is the version tested and passed by QA, and was the upgrade function tested successfully during internal testing?

    A: Confirm that it is correct.

1. Q: Confirm that the version being used matches the version of the Kubernetes cluster used for testing?

    A: v1.21 (version being used), v1.26 (version used for testing).

1. Q: Based on the error screenshot and the above information, it is initially inferred that the customer's
   Kubernetes cluster version does not match the corresponding CRD. Additionally, skoala-init provides initial
   conditional configurations for all microservices, which includes multiple CRDs. According to the
   skoala-init v0.12.0 ChangeLog, the Gateway-API CRD has been upgraded. Therefore, the inference is:

    A: The issue is caused by the upgrade of the Gateway-API.

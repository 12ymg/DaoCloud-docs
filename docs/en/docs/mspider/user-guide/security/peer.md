# Peer Authentication

Peer authentication refers to providing two-way security authentication between services without intrusive modification of the application source code. At the same time, the creation, distribution, and rotation of secrets and certificates are also automatically completed by the system, which is transparent to users. The complexity of security configuration management is greatly reduced.

!!! note

    After peer authentication is enabled, the corresponding target rule also needs to enable mLTS mode, otherwise it will not be able to access normally.

A strict mTLS policy enforced across the mesh. Once in effect, inter-service access within the mesh will require mLTS to be enabled.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
kind: "PeerAuthentication"
metadata:
  name: "default"
  namespace: "istio-system" #effective namespace
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT #strategy
```

Service mesh provides two creation methods: wizard and YAML. The specific steps to create through the wizard are as follows:

1. Click `Security` -> `Peer Authentication` in the left navigation bar, and click the `Create` button in the upper right corner.

2. In the `Create Peer Authentication` interface, first perform the basic configuration and then click `Next`.

3. After completing the authentication settings according to the screen prompts, click `OK`.

4. The screen prompts that the creation is successful.

5. On the right side of the list, click `â‹®` in the operation column to perform more operations through the pop-up menu.

# Create a pipeline based on a built-in template

Workbench module supports quick creation of pipelines based on built-in templates or user-defined [custom templates](../template/custom-template.md). According to common use cases, Workbench module has built-in Golang, Nodejs, and Maven templates.

## Steps

The steps to create a pipeline based on a built-in template are as follows:

1. Click __Create Pipeline__ on the pipeline list page.

3. Select the appropriate pipeline template and click __Next__.

    > All built-in templates are listed under the __Recommended Templates__ heading, and all custom templates created by users are listed under the __Custom Templates__ heading.

4. Fill in the pipeline configuration by referring to [custom pipeline creation](custom.md), and then click __Next__.

5. Fill in the template parameters by referring to the following instructions, and then click __OK__.

    - Code warehouse address: the address of the remote code warehouse, required
    - Branch: The code of which branch is used to build the pipeline, required
    - Credentials: If it is a private warehouse, you need to [create a credential](../credential.md) in advance and select the credential here
    - Test command: unit test command

        > If using a Golang template, the test command defaults to __go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.out__
        > If using Nodejs template, the test command defaults to __npm test__
        > If using a Maven template, the test command defaults to __mvn -B test -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true__

    - Test report location: where the test report is located and analyzed to generate a test report
    - Dockerfile path: the absolute path of the Dockerfile in the code warehouse, required
    - Target mirror address: enter the name of the mirror warehouse, required
    - tag: Add a tag to the newly generated image after running this pipeline
    - Container registry credentials: Credentials for accessing the mirror repository. If it is a private warehouse, you need to [create a credential](../credential.md) in advance and select the credential here
